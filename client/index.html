      SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT IN NUMEROUS WAYS.
      In front of the tiny pupil of the eye they put, on Mount Palomar, a great
      monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see 2000 times farther into
      the depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged
      as a microscope into a drop of water or blood, and magnify by as much as
      2000 diameters the living creatures there, many of which are among man’s
      most dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happenings on earth,
      they use some of the previously wasted electromagnetic waves to carry
      television images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals
      on a screen with electrons in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of
      long ago and far away as colored motion pictures, by arranging silver
      atoms and color-absorbing molecules to force light waves into the patterns
      of original reality. Or if we want to see into the center of a steel
      casting or the chest of an injured child, they send the information on a
      beam of penetrating short-wave X rays, and then convert it back into
      images we can see on a screen or photograph. THUS ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF
      ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION YET DISCOVERED HAS BEEN USED TO EXTEND OUR SENSE
      OF SIGHT IN SOME WAY.

      Use transition words or phrases between sentences and between paragraphs.
      Transitional expressions emphasize the relationships between ideas, so
      they help readers follow your train of thought or see connections that
      they might otherwise miss or misunderstand. The following paragraph shows
      how carefully chosen transitions (CAPITALIZED) lead the reader smoothly
      from the introduction to the conclusion of the paragraph. I don’t wish to
      deny that the flattened, minuscule head of the large-bodied "stegosaurus"
      houses little brain from our subjective, top-heavy perspective, BUT I do
      wish to assert that we should not expect more of the beast. FIRST OF ALL,
      large animals have relatively smaller brains than related, small animals.
      The correlation of brain size with body size among kindred animals (all
      reptiles, all mammals, FOR EXAMPLE) is remarkably regular. AS we move from
      small to large animals, from mice to elephants or small lizards to Komodo
      dragons, brain size increases, BUT not so fast as body size. IN OTHER
      WORDS, bodies grow faster than brains, AND large animals have low ratios
      of brain weight to body weight. IN FACT, brains grow only about two-thirds
      as fast as bodies. SINCE we have no reason to believe that large animals
      are consistently stupider than their smaller relatives, we must conclude
      that large animals require relatively less brain to do as well as smaller
      animals. IF we do not recognize this relationship, we are likely to
      underestimate the mental power of very large animals, dinosaurs in
      particular.
